Thanks Carolina Cesar for the photo!\n\n\n\nI developed a fascination for marine biology as a kid and stuck with it. I received a BS in Marine Science and Biology from the University of Miami, USA, and then went on to get a Master’s in Marine Affairs and Policy from the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and the Marine Policy Center at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. From there, I pursued a doctoral degree in Marine Ecosystem Health and Conservation at the University of Plymouth, UK and University of Pavia, Italy through an Erasmus Mundus Doctoral Fellowship. I am now an organismal marine biologist and work at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow.\nMy current research is based at the Bocas Research Station in Bocas del Toro, Panama, where I investigate how global change is impacting tropical marine life. I integrate physiology, ecology and oceanography into laboratory manipulations and field experiments to advance our understanding of how marine animals can survive climate stress.\nThere are mountains of evidence articulating the fact that global change is impacting marine life and the people that depend on it. But if we can better understand the mechanisms (i.e., the how) involved in marine organism’s capacity to survive climate change, then we can prepare for the changing oceans. I believe it is our responsibility to do research that is purposefully directed toward combating the problems facing our oceans. Therefore, my research tries to significantly mitigate the current trajectory of ocean health.\nKeywords: ecophysiology, ocean deoxygenation, ocean warming, acidification, adaptation, biogeography, modern extinctions, phenotypic plasticity, climate change, marine policy, climate resilience, tropical ecosystems, marine invertebrates\nActive Research Projects\nBelow are the active and planned experiments for 2022.

Plasticity and adaptation\na) Multi-generations and multi-stressors\n\nPhenotypic plasticity under low O2 and high temp\n\nRising seawater temperatures combined with rapidly emergent coastal deoxygenation are expected to detrimentally impact many marine organisms. Already, the increasing magnitude and frequency of these anthropogenic perturbations have been directly linked to local extinctions. Understanding if and how long-term persistence of species in these environments can be achieved through evolutionary pathways is an understudied and pertinent field of research –with the potential to improve biodiversity predictions and focus coastal management plans. Here we investigated how within-generation plasticity, transgenerational plasticity, and local adaptation influences long-term persistence of populations of marine ectotherms in deoxygenated and warming coastal habitats. We use replicated populations of Caribbean ostracod species (Skogsbernia lerneri) from three sites that form an oxy-thermal gradient with mild, medium and severe low-O2 and warming and monitored life histories adjustments over three generations.\nStatus: Experiments complete, data analysis and write-up active\nCollaborators: Rachel Collin\nb) Can corals adapt to ocean deoxygenation?\nThe adaptive capacity of corals to temperature and deoxygenation is thought to be fairly high. But their capacity to adapt to a deoxygenating and warming ocean has not yet been documented. Here we will determine if corals from a hot, low oxygen reef have adapted to warming, deoxygenated waters. We will do this by implementing a two-part reciprocal transplant experiment: 1) laboratory-based and 2) in situ based. In the laboratory reciprocal transplant, we collect colonies of two species finding broad-sense heritability of survival, bleaching response, zoox density, calcification, respiration, and photosynthesis rates, as well as Phi (Metabolic Index).\nWe will collect corals from two sites along an oxygen-temperature gradient. After fragmenting these colonies to attain genetic ‘clones’ we will allow a 2 week recovery ‘common garden’ period in the laboratory. After recovery, we will outplant half of these fragments at the collection sites. The other half of coral fragments will be put into a laboratory-based reciprocal transplant experiment. Laboratory oxygen and temperature treatments will be based on the environmental conditions measured at the collection sites. After two weeks, we will coral physiology of all living fragments, and we will determine the ‘genotypic’ performance at different oxygen/temp. levels.\nTraits: the survival, bleaching response, zoox counts, calcification, respiration, and photosynthesis rates, Phi (Metabolic Index),\nSites - Crawl Key - Pastores – Siderastrea siderea (40 ft)\nStatus: Experiment starting Feb. 2022\n2. Ocean deoxygenation ecology\na) Mass mortality of coral reefs\nHypocolypse website\nb) How does coastal deoxygenation destabilize marine communities?\nClimate change is disproportionately impacting coastal marine ecosystems through complex interactive multiple stressors. Microbes are without a doubt important in these coastal systems, yet the microbial ecology of many marine systems is still poorly understood. Our research aims to address pressing questions regarding which microbial assemblages are correlated to broad-scale ecosystem shifts in coastal habitats. We measured environmental oxygen, temperature, and pH weekly over the course of a year at four shallow sites (~20 m) along a natural ~15 km gradient in a Caribbean Bay. In addition to environmental parameters, we collected weekly sediment samples and determined the abundance and diversity of both the macrofauna and microbial communities (16S rRNA) throughout the year. At sites with severe deoxygenation (compared to more normoxic sites), we find a strong relationship between reduced macrofaunal abundance and diversity, as well as significant increases in microbial community instability. Using an integrative time-series approach we identify specific oxygen thresholds that appear to underpin changes in both macro- and micro- benthic diversity. Oxygen stress plays a major role in community destabilization through space and time.\nCollaborators: Jarrod J Scott, Rachel Collin\nStatus: Data collection complete, active data analysis and writing\nProject website: https://tropical-repo.github.io/trepo-summary.html\nc) Community metabolism drives extreme ocean weather\nPrior monitoring at tropical marine sites throughout the Bocas del Toro archipelago suggest that community metabolism is responsible for driving increased pO2 variability, not just temperature. Here we determine if this is true by correlating oxygen and temperature measurements from sites with differences in species richness.\nWe will take photos/video along 50 m transects at all sites with existing logger data, count and identify living substrate. After finding estimates of site richness, we will relate our continuous time-series O2 and temperature data to see if community metabolism explains O2 variability, and to what extent temperature plays a role in these processes.\nStatus: Logger data collected, open ecology project.\nd) Biodiversity and resilience of corals and their microbiomes in response to ocean deoxygenation\nHow do Caribbean coral communities respond to ocean deoxygenation? With a newly awarded NSF grant to PI Andrew Altieri, Julie Meyer and Rachel Collin, we are trying to understand how the feedbacks between cnidarian hosts and their microbiomes underlie the resilience of corals to ocean deoxygenation.\nWe are aiming to answer the following questions in the next 3 years:\nHow does the physiological response of the coral to hypoxia predict community shifts in the microbiome with deoxygenation?\nTo what degree do corals and their microbiomes show evidence of acclimatization to reduced oxygen, and how do these functional shifts confer increased resistance to subsequent hypoxic stress?\nHow are the feedbacks between coral hosts and their microbiomes apparent in the recovery of coral communities from hypoxia and patterns of community structure at the seascape scale?\nStatus: Active, open\nCollaborators: Andrew Altieri, Julie Meyer, Rachel Collin, Carolina Cesar, Rachel , Monica\n3. Oxygen stress physiology\na) Oxygen limits of corals\nHow do corals breath? Can they regulate their oxygen uptake? What is their tolerance to low oxygen under warming? Are corals living to their oxygen threshold/limits? These are questions we are answering with experiments in the lab.\nThere is a growing realization that ocean deoxygenation is a major global problem that is hurting marine life and that this deoxygenation is directly related to rising seawater temperature. It is also well known that coral reefs are dying at a rapid pace. But we have no direct measure of what coral limits are to deoxygenation under warming. Here we are measured the oxygen limits (Pcrit) of eight different coral species along a 10 C temperature range. Preliminary data suggests they all actively regulate their oxygen consumption to a point: their oxygen limits are near the daily minimum environmental oxygen levels measured from the reef habitats they live in at night. This indicates oxygen has a much bigger role in coral reef survival than previously thought, and that climate-mediated ocean deoxygenation should be considered a top research priority.\nCollaborators: Carolina Cesar, Esme Kline, Julie Meyer, Andrew Altieri, Rachel Collin\nStatus: Experiment active from Nov. 2021 - Feb. 2022.\nb) Does coral morphology dictates oxygen control?\nIt is thought that marine ectotherms that are able to regulate their oxygen uptake from the environment (oxy-regulators) will be more tolerant to ocean deoxygenation compared to species that cannot (oxy-conformers). Preliminary data suggests on 2 species of branching coral species have little ability to modulate their oxygen regulation, while 2 species of mounding massive corals seem to be oxyregulators. Is this pattern found across multiple phylogenetic systems?\ntest oxygen uptake in three sets of species that have both mounding and branching forms (i.e., Porites asteriodes and Porites porites)\ntest these species’ tolerance to low O2 by manipulating oxygen in the lab (control, low, moderately low O2 conditions for a 12 h duration)\nStatus: Open\nc) Oxygen evolution, photosynthesis and bleaching\nThe symbiosis of the coral host and algal cells that live inside their tissues is based on a delicate balance. The zoox. algae provide food (CaCO3) for the coral host via photosynthesis. This allows the coral to grow by creating its skeleton. These symbiotic algae produce oxygen as a byproduct from the process of photosynthesis. This oxygen byproduct is released into the surrounding environment of the coral host. This has been attributed to supersaturated dissolved oxygen levels during the day on some coral reefs. But there are growing examples of low environmental oxygen levels on tropical reef environments. Here we determine the bleaching responses of 8 different coral species to deoxygenation under both light and dark conditions, at along a range of temperatures.\nDark: 1) Manipulate oxygen levels in aquarium to represent Pcrit oxygen conditions for 6 hours 2) Determine if bleaching varies across species (i.e., which species bleach?) 3) Determine if bleaching responses vary by temperature (i.e., what temperature-oxygen combination impacts bleaching?\nLight: 1) Manipulate oxygen levels in aquarium to represent Pcrit oxygen conditions for 6 hours 2) Determine if bleaching varies across species (i.e., which species bleach?) 3) Determine if bleaching responses vary by temperature (i.e., what temperature-oxygen combination impacts bleaching?\nIs low oxygen during the day more detrimental than low oxygen at night?\nStatus: Open\n4. Changing ocean biogeography\na) Forcing brittle stars out of the tropics\n\nClimate warming erodes tropical reef habitat through frequency and intensity of episodic hypoxia\n\nClimate warming threatens marine life by increasing metabolic oxygen demand while decreasing oxygen availability. Tropical species living in warm, low oxygen environments may be most at risk, but their tolerances and exposures to these stressors remain poorly documented. We evaluated habitat restrictions for two brittle star species from Caribbean coral reefs by integrating field observations, laboratory experiments and ecophysiological modelling. The absence of one species from the warmest reefs results from restriction of vital activity during episodic low oxygen extremes. We find the frequency and intensity of these events significantly increase with warming, which will progressively exclude ever more hypoxia-tolerant species – even if average oxygen remains constant. A warming-driven increase in frequency or intensity of low oxygen extremes could similarly accelerate habitat loss across other marine ecosystems.\nCollaborators: Curtis Deutsch, Rachel Collin, Piero Calosi\nStatus: Manuscript in review Nature Climate Change\nProject website coming soon!\nb) How ubiquitous are low oxygen extreme events due to warming?\nWe find warming increases the frequency and intensity of hypoxia (i.e. the ‘wedge’) on coral reefs in Bocas del Toro. We also determined that these hypoxic episodes are directly responsible for setting species’ range limits. If this relationship between increasing temperatures and oxygen extremes occurs across other seascapes (i.e. salt marshes, mangroves, open ocean, other coral reefs), then it would indicate habitat loss is occurring at a much larger scale. Therefore, we will determine how ubiquitous the relationship between warming and low oxygen intensity and frequency across seascapes globally. We will use measured observations and Earth System models for this. Observations are likely scarce, and models are likely wrong (lacking a wedge), but both will have some value.\nCreate a database of oxygen and temperature data from all available data sources, covering as many locations and environments as data availability allows.\nAnalyze each dataset by plotting it in a 2D space to see if there is a wedge (O2 against temperature)\nDetermine how strong the relationship is statisitically\nBuild a map showing where the ‘wedge’ shows up\nBackground: The frequency of marine heat waves is increasing, as are documented cases of extreme hypoxic events along coasts globally. There is a well known relationship between oxygen and temperature, with increasing temperatures commonly associated with lower oxygen levels due to the amount of oxygen saturated. New data suggests that there is also a relationship between warming and oxygen extremes, with oxygen variability increasing as a function of temperature. But our understanding of the extent of the correlation between oxygen and temperature is limited. We need to determine if warming, deoxygenation and the resultant short-term metabolic ‘waves’ impact marine habitability across marine ecosystems. Here we analyze global datasets to we determine the how common the relationship between extreme oxygen events and warming is.\nCollaborators: Alaina Eckert and Curtis Deutsch\nStatus: Starting Feb. 2022\nc) Extending Janzen’s hypothesis from the mountains into the sea\nIn the 1960’s Dan Janzen introduces the idea that abiotic clines set species’ ranges limits in terrestrial systems. He used mountains to illustrate how an animal’s ability to survive at a particular ‘elevation’ is dictated by the intensity and variability of physical conditions – particularly temperature, i.e. high up on a mountain, extreme conditions can prevent generalists from living at that elevation. These simple findings have transformed our understanding of terrestrial biogeography. In stark contrast, parallel research in marine environments is lagging far behind our understanding of terrestrial biogeography.\nOne clear distinction between terrestrial and marine systems is that the abiotic variables dictating habitability in the ocean must consider both temperature and oxygen together. These two physical conditions are causing the most severe, rapid ecosystem changes compared to all other physical parameters on a global scale. This is because oxygen is rapidly declining in all oceanic systems as the planet warms. Moreover, these abiotic climatic variables impact biotic variables: rising temperatures increase the metabolic rates and oxygen demand of most animals. Accurately predicting where species can live in our changing oceans must then include oxygen dynamics, temperature as well as species-specific physiological limits. A metabolic index has recently been developed to specifically address this research gap (Deutsch et al., 2015). Enormous potential for this framework to improve our predictive ability of marine habitability in the context of ocean deoxygenation and warming has been verified in some habitats (i.e., Lucey, Deutsch, et al., review). But if the primary mechanism of biodiversity loss and reduced habitability are due to metabolic restrictions, this needs to be verified across differing seascapes and timeframes – as Dan Janzen did with temperature in terrestrial mountain systems years ago. Therefore, we propose to verify the use of metabolism as a key to identify where marine species’ can - and will - persist across physical oceanographic clines.\nMeasure the tolerance of key species to warming and reduced oxygen from different oxygen regimes (i.e., upwelling in Tropical Eastern Pacific, eutrophication under warming in Caribbean).\nPredator - Fireworm Pcrit – multiple temps\nHerbivore - Sea urchin Pcrit – multiple temps\nScavenger - Shrimp Pcrit – multiple temps\n\nMeasure the fine scale oxygen and temperature dynamics in these systems across time and depth\nCaribbean logger arrays at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 m: Crawl Key, Hospital Point, Pastores\nPacific logger arrays at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 m: Las Perlas\n\nThis research will be used to understand the extent of habitability today and to model likely habitat occupancy changes in the future, on both regional and global scales.\nStatus: Active, Preliminary data collection phase\nCollaborators: Curtis Deutsch, Rachel Collin, Carolina Cesar\nBig thanks to the advice and tutorial developed by Jarrod J Scott that made this website possible\n\n\n\n",
